# HTML-resume
This is part of the Capstone Projects. In my bootcamp, we were given to create a website that will contain our resume, but we were not given example code or how our resume should look like. Thus, this is based on my own creativity and passion. I have created this resume only with HTML since this is the only material we have learned so far in the course.
